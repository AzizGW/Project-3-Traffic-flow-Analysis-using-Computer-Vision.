The focus of this project is to analyze traffic flow dynamics through the lens of computer vision, leveraging a sample (one week data) from the dataset provided by the "Watch And Learn Time-Lapse (WALT) Dataset" project (Reddy et al., 2022). This dataset contains various vehicle types and pedestrian traffic across different times and locations. The primary motivation is to understand the distribution of traffic components (cars, buses, trucks, and persons, etc...)
